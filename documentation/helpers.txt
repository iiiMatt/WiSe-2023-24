Phi Measure of Dispersion for Categorial Data

Description:

     Computes the phi measure of dispersion which produces more
     intuitive numbers between 0 and 1 but is not popular unlike
     entropy.

Usage:

     phi_dispersion(x, na.rm = TRUE)
     
Arguments:

       x: A categorial variable.

   na.rm: Indicates if NA values should be removed before calculation.

Details:

     Task 2b

Value:

     A floating point number between 0 and 1 (lower than entropy).

Statistical Mode

Description:

     Returns the most frequently occuring value in x. If there are
     multiple values that occur most frequently this function returns
     all of them.

Usage:

     statistical_mode(x, na.rm = TRUE)
     
Arguments:

       x: Can be a list, vector or factor.

   na.rm: Indicates if NA values should be removed before calculation.

Details:

     Task 2b

Value:

     The statistical mode of x. One or multiple values.

Empirical Entropy

Description:

     Computes the average empirical entropy (according to Boltzmann's
     formula) of all levels. This is a measure of dispersion that
     returns 1 if every level occurs with the same frequency and 0 if
     only one level occurs 100% of the time.

Usage:

     empirical_entropy(x, na.rm = TRUE)
     
Arguments:

       x: A categorial variable.

   na.rm: Indicates if NA values should be removed before calculation.

Details:

     Task 2b

Value:

     A floating point number between 0 and 1.
