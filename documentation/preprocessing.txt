Encode Variables

Description:

     Turns the columns "Sex", "Survived" and "Embarked" into a factor
     and "Pclass" into an ordered factor.

Usage:

     encode_variables(dataset)
     
Arguments:

 dataset: The titanic dataset.

Details:

     Task 1

Value:

     The same dataset with the above mentioned columns as factors.

Extract Salutations

Description:

     Extracts the salutations from the name column and creates a new
     column with the extracted salutations in the dataset.

Usage:

     extract_salutations(dataset)
     
Arguments:

 dataset: The titanic dataset.

Details:

     Task 1

Value:

     The same dataset with the additional column "Salutation".

Extract Cabin Data

Description:

     Deck (which is the letter the cabin starts with) and Side (which
     is starboard for odd and port for even cabin numbers) are
     extracted from Cabin and encoded as factors.

Usage:

     extract_cabin_data(dataset)
     
Arguments:

 dataset: The original dataset

Details:

     Task 1

     In the event that a combination of cabins is listed for each a
     group of multiple people the cabins are distributed arbitrarily
     among the group. Example: If there are four people in the dataset
     that have "A11 B12 C13" as the cabin, these four people will be
     assigned "A11" "B12" "C13" "A11". This way the number of people
     with a cabin can be guaranteed to be the same as in the original
     dataset and the distribution of cabins should roughly match the
     original data.

Value:

     The same dataset with the additional columns Deck and Side

Generate Preprocessed Data

Description:

     Generates the preprocessed data from the dataset in "titanic.csv"
     by running all the preprocessing functions and saves the cleaned
     dataset into the file "titanic_cleaned.Rds".

Usage:

     generate_preprocessed_data()
     
Details:

     Task 1

Infer Age

Description:

     Fills in the missing ages in the dataset using the salutations

Usage:

     infer_age(dataset)
     
Arguments:

 dataset: The titanic dataset.

Details:

     Task 1

Value:

     The same dataset with a mutated "Age" column
