Mosaicplot

Description:

     The function takes two variables, var1 and var2, as inputs. It
     then creates a mosaic plot using these variables

Usage:

     Mosaikplot(var1, var2)
     
Arguments:

    var1: One variable

    var2: Another variable

Details:

     Task 2a vi.

Value:

     a mosaicplot

Boxplots with Trendline

Description:

     The function takes two variables, var1 and var2, as inputs. It
     then creates a boxplot of var2 against var1, with a trendline
     added.

Usage:

     Boxplots_with_Trendline(var1, var2)
     
Arguments:

    var1: One variable

    var2: Another variable

Details:

     Task 2a vi.

Value:

     a boxplot with trendlinie

Visualize Categorical Variables Relation to Survival on Titanic

Description:

     This function creates visualizations for the relationship between
     survival and three categorical variables: Passenger Class
     (Pclass), Sex, and Embarkation Point (Embarked)

Usage:

     visualize_categorical_variables(df)
     
Arguments:

      df: A dataframe

Details:

     Task 2a v.

Value:

     Returns a grid of three plots visualizing the survival rates by
     Passenger Class, Sex, and Embarkation Point.

Calculate Descriptive and Inferential Statistics for a Metric and a
Dichotomous Variable

Description:

     This function calculates and outputs the mean, standard deviation,
     and performs a t-test to assess the difference in a metric
     variable across two groups defined by a dichotomous variable. It's
     useful for understanding how the metric variable differs between
     two groups, such as comparing the average fare paid by passengers
     who survived vs. those who did not.

Usage:

     calculateBivariateStats(data, metricVar, dichotomousVar)
     
Arguments:

    data: A dataframe containing the dataset.

metricVar: The name of the metric variable as a string.

dichotomousVar: The name of the dichotomous variable as a string.

Details:

     Task 2a iv.

Bivariate descriptive statistics for categorial variables

Description:

     Calcualates and prints the results of descriptive bivariate
     statistics of a contengency table and a chi squared test for two
     categorical variables.

Usage:

     chisq_test_plus_table(kat_var1, kat_var2)
     
Arguments:

kat_var1: A kategorical variable

kat_var2: A second kategorical variable with the same length as the
          first

Details:

     Task 2a iii.

Descriptive statistics for a metric variable

Description:

     Returns some descriptive statistics for a metric variable in form
     of a dataframe for simple formatting. All NA values are removed
     before calculation.

Usage:

     describe_metric(x)
     
Arguments:

       x: A metric variable.

Details:

     Task 2a i.

Value:

     A one row dataframe with the different statistics in columns.

Descriptive statistics for a categorial variable

Description:

     Prints descriptive statistics for a categorial variable x and
     additional ones for ordered factors. Namely the calculated
     statistics are the statistical mode, empirical entropy and phi
     measure of dispersion and optionally the median and quartiles.

Usage:

     describe_categorial(x, name = deparse(match.call()$x), na.rm = TRUE)
     
Arguments:

       x: A factor (may be ordered).

    name: The name of the factor. By default whatever was passed to x
          so for describe_categorial(data$Pclass) name would default to
          "data$Pclass".

   na.rm: Indicates if NA values should be removed before calculation.

Details:

     Task 2a ii.
